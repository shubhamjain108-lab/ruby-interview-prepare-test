Given an array of positive integers nums, return the maximum possible sum of an strictly increasing subarray in nums.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous sequence of numbers in an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,20,30,5,10,50]
Output: 65
Explanation: [5,10,50] is the ascending subarray with the maximum sum of 65.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,20,30,40,50]
Output: 150
Explanation: [10,20,30,40,50] is the ascending subarray with the maximum sum of 150.
